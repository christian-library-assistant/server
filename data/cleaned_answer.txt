  "answer": "Well, according to Augustine, grace can be understood in a few ways based on how he discusses it. Sometimes he speaks of \"operative grace\" as being \"faith that works by love\" or \"faith that worketh by charity\" (Augustine, De Spir. et Lit.), seeing this act of faith as the first way sanctifying grace becomes evident. He also describes grace as the gratuitous will of God, by which God freely bestows benefits (Augustine). Augustine divides grace into operating and cooperating grace. He says that God begins by operating in us to make us willing, and then cooperates with us as we will, to bring us to perfection (Augustine, De Gratia et Lib. Arbit.). He also notes that while the name \"grace\" especially signifies the remission of sins, it also encompasses many other gifts from God (Augustine, Retract.).",
